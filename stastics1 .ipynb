    "It is important to understand the level of measurement when analyzing data because the type of data collected determines the validity of statistical techniques that can be used for analysis. Different statistical methods are appropriate for different levels of measurement. Using inappropriate statistical techniques may lead to incorrect conclusions and interpretations of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we have data on the temperature (measured in Celsius) of different cities, we cannot use the ratio level techniques to calculate the mean temperature of the cities. This is because Celsius temperature scales do not have a true zero point. If we convert the Celsius temperature into Kelvin temperature scale (which does have a true zero point) and calculate the mean, we can use ratio level techniques.\n",

The mode is particularly useful when dealing with categorical data.\n",
